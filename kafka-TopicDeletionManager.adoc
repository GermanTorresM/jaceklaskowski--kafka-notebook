== [[TopicDeletionManager]] TopicDeletionManager

`TopicDeletionManager` is...FIXME

`TopicDeletionManager` is <<creating-instance, created>> exclusively when `KafkaController` is link:kafka-KafkaController.adoc#topicDeletionManager[created].

.TopicDeletionManager is Created Alongside KafkaController
image::images/TopicDeletionManager.png[align="center"]

`TopicDeletionManager` is controlled by link:kafka-properties.adoc#delete.topic.enable[delete.topic.enable] Kafka property and does nothing when it is turned off (i.e. `false`).

[[logIdent]]
`logIdent` is *[Topic Deletion Manager [brokerId]]*.

[TIP]
====
Enable `INFO` logging level for `kafka.controller.TopicDeletionManager` logger to see what happens inside.

Add the following line to `config/log4j.properties`:

```
log4j.logger.kafka.controller.TopicDeletionManager=INFO, stdout
```

Refer to link:kafka-logging.adoc[Logging].

=== [[creating-instance]] Creating TopicDeletionManager Instance

`TopicDeletionManager` takes the following when created:

* [[controller]] link:kafka-KafkaController.adoc[KafkaController]
* [[eventManager]] link:kafka-ControllerEventManager.adoc[ControllerEventManager]

`TopicDeletionManager` initializes the <<internal-registries, internal registries and counters>>.

=== [[markTopicIneligibleForDeletion]] `markTopicIneligibleForDeletion` Method

[source, scala]
----
markTopicIneligibleForDeletion(topics: Set[String]): Unit
----

(only with link:kafka-properties.adoc#delete.topic.enable[delete.topic.enable] Kafka property enabled) `markTopicIneligibleForDeletion` computes the intersection between <<topicsToBeDeleted, topicsToBeDeleted>> and the input `topics` sets and adds the intersection to <<topicsIneligibleForDeletion, topicsIneligibleForDeletion>> set.

If there are any topics in the intersection, `markTopicIneligibleForDeletion` prints out the following INFO message to the logs:

```
Halted deletion of topics [newTopicsToHaltDeletion]
```

[NOTE]
====
`markTopicIneligibleForDeletion` is used when:

* `KafkaController` link:kafka-KafkaController.adoc#initiateReassignReplicasForTopicPartition[initiateReassignReplicasForTopicPartition]

* `TopicDeletion` controller event is link:kafka-ControllerEvent-TopicDeletion.adoc#partitionReassignmentInProgress[processed] (for topics to be deleted with partitions in `controllerContext.partitionsBeingReassigned` list)

* `TopicDeletionManager` does <<startReplicaDeletion, startReplicaDeletion>> and <<failReplicaDeletion, failReplicaDeletion>>
====

=== [[reset]] Reseting -- `reset` Method

[source, scala]
----
reset(): Unit
----

(only with link:kafka-properties.adoc#delete.topic.enable[delete.topic.enable] Kafka property enabled) `reset` removes all elements from the following internal registries:

* <<topicsToBeDeleted, topicsToBeDeleted>>
* <<partitionsToBeDeleted, partitionsToBeDeleted>>
* <<topicsIneligibleForDeletion, topicsIneligibleForDeletion>>

NOTE: `reset` does nothing when link:kafka-properties.adoc#delete.topic.enable[delete.topic.enable] Kafka property is `false`.

NOTE: `reset` is used exclusively when `KafkaController` link:kafka-KafkaController.adoc#onControllerResignation[resigns as the active controller].
