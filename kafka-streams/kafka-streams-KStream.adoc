== [[KStream]] KStream

`KStream` is an abstraction of a *record stream* of key-value pairs (where each record represents an independent entity or event in the real world).

`KStream` is created directly from one or many Kafka topics (using link:kafka-streams-StreamsBuilder.adoc[StreamsBuilder.stream]) or through `KStream` transformations.

import org.apache.kafka.streams.StreamsBuilder
val builder = new StreamsBuilder

import org.apache.kafka.streams.kstream.KStream
// Use type annotation to describe the stream, i.e. KStream[String, String]
// Else...Scala type inferencer gives us a stream of "nothing", i.e. KStream[Nothing, Nothing]
val input: KStream[String, String] = builder.stream("input")
