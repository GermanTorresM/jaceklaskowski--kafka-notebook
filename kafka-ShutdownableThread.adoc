=== [[run]] `run` Method

[source, scala]
----
run(): Unit
----

NOTE: `run` is a part of http://download.java.net/java/jdk9/docs/api/java/lang/Runnable.html#run--[java.lang.Runnable] that is executed when the thread is started.

`run` first prints out the following INFO message to the logs:

```
Starting
```

`run` then executes <<doWork, doWork>> method until <<isRunning, isRunning>> flag is disabled.

In the end, `run` decrements the count of <<shutdownLatch, shutdownLatch>> and prints out the following INFO message to the logs:

```
Stopped
```
