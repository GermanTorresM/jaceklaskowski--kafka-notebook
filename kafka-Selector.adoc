== [[Selector]] Selector -- Selectable on Socket Channels (from Java's New IO API)

`Selector` is the one and only link:kafka-Selectable.adoc[Selectable] that uses Java's selectable channels for stream-oriented connecting sockets (i.e. Java's http://download.java.net/java/jdk9/docs/api/java/nio/channels/SocketChannel.html[java.nio.channels.SocketChannel]).

`Selector` is used by Kafka services to link:kafka-clients-NetworkClient.adoc#creating-instance[create] a `NetworkClient`.

.Selector is Created for Kafka Services For NetworkClient

`Selector` is created when:

* `KafkaAdminClient` is created (using `createInternal`)
* `KafkaConsumer` is created
* `KafkaProducer` is created
* `AdminClient` is created
* `ControllerChannelManager` is requested to <<kafka-controller-ControllerChannelManager.adoc#addNewBroker, addNewBroker>>
* `TransactionMarkerChannelManager` is created
* `Processor` is created
* `KafkaServer` does `doControlledShutdown`
* `ReplicaFetcherBlockingSend` is created
